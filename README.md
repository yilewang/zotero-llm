**Zotero-LLM** is a powerful plugin for [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into the Zotero PDF reader. Unlike other tools that require you to upload your pdfs to a portal, this plugin is designed to conveniently access LLMs without the need to leave Zotero. It quietly sits in the panel of the Zotero reader, like your standby research assistant, ready to help you with any questions you have when reading a paper.

  - Summaries

  - Key Points (bulleted lists)

  - Methodology breakdowns

  - Limitations & Future Work analysis

### FAQ

> Q: Is it free to use?

A: Yes, absolutely free. You only pay for API calls, if you choose to use a paid API provider. If you think this tool is helpful, please consider supporting me with a star on GitHub or [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/yat.lok) .

> Q: Does this work with local models?

A: Yes! You can point the plugin to a local endpoint (like Ollama) to run models entirely offline for maximum privacy.

> Q: Is my data used to train models?

A: No. Since you use your own API key, your data privacy is governed by the terms of the API provider you choose (e.g., OpenAI Enterprise terms usually exclude training on API data).

> Q: If I have any questions, how to contact you?

A: Please feel free to open an issue on GitHub! I will try my best to help you.
